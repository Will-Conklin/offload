# Discovery Agent Guide

This file provides agent-only instructions for documentation in `docs/discovery/`.
README files are informational for users.

## Scope

- Applies to `docs/discovery/**`
- Defers to `docs/AGENTS.md` for global documentation rules

## Purpose

Explore feature possibilities and gather context before formal requirements (non-authoritative).

## Contains

- Initial feature exploration
- Problem space investigation
- User need discovery
- Competitive analysis
- Feasibility assessment
- Open questions and uncertainties

## When to create

- At the very beginning of feature exploration
- Before PRD creation
- When problem space is unclear
- When feasibility is uncertain

## Lifecycle

- Created first, before PRDs
- Status: active -> completed or abandoned
- Non-authoritative (never treated as requirements)
- Archived or deleted after PRD creation

## Format expectations

- Exploratory and informal
- Questions and hypotheses
- Preliminary findings
- Links to research that may follow

## Boundaries

- Does not define requirements (see PRDs)
- Does not make decisions (see ADRs)
- Does not replace formal research (see research/)
- Must transition to PRD to become authoritative
