### Command Reference

```bash
# Testing
xcodebuild test -scheme Offload -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

# Find remaining issues
grep -r "try?" ios/Offload --include="*.swift" | grep -v "test"
grep -r "!" ios/Offload --include="*.swift" | grep "URL(string:"
grep -r "\.padding()" ios/Offload --include="*.swift" | grep -v "Theme.Spacing"

# Performance profiling
instruments -t "Time Profiler" -D trace.trace path/to/Offload.app

## Appendix B: Testing Checklist (Comprehensive)

### Phase 1-3 Remediation Testing

#### Critical Bug Verification
- [ ] Toast cancellation works (rapid show, auto-dismiss, manual dismiss)
- [ ] No race conditions in delete operations
- [ ] All 21 error suppressions properly handled
- [ ] Repository queries use predicates (verify via code review)
- [ ] Relationships properly declared (verify models)
- [ ] No force unwraps crash (test URL validation)
- [ ] MainActor synchronization correct (test concurrent captures)
- [ ] Input validation prevents invalid API endpoints

#### Performance Validation
- [ ] Query benchmarks at 100 records: <10ms
- [ ] Query benchmarks at 1000 records: <100ms
- [ ] Query benchmarks at 10000 records: <1000ms
- [ ] Memory usage stable during bulk operations
- [ ] No memory leaks detected (Instruments)

---

### UI Foundation Testing

#### Visual Consistency
- [ ] Light mode: All screens render correctly
- [ ] Dark mode: All screens render correctly
- [ ] Glass effects visible but subtle
- [ ] Corner radius consistent throughout
- [ ] Spacing consistent (no hardcoded values visible)
- [ ] Shadows provide appropriate depth
- [ ] Gradients render correctly

#### Device Compatibility
- [ ] iPhone SE (small screen) - all content accessible
- [ ] iPhone 14/15 Pro (standard) - optimal layout
- [ ] iPhone 15 Pro Max (large) - no wasted space
- [ ] Portrait orientation works
- [ ] Landscape orientation works (if supported)

---

### Component Testing

#### Badge Component
- [ ] Category badges render with correct colors
- [ ] Status badges show appropriate states
- [ ] Icons display when provided
- [ ] Text truncates gracefully for long labels
- [ ] Tappable area meets 44pt minimum

#### Expandable Card
- [ ] Tap to expand works smoothly
- [ ] Animation is spring-based and smooth
- [ ] Collapsed state shows 2-line preview
- [ ] Expanded state shows full content
- [ ] No layout jumping during expansion

#### Other Components
- [ ] Pill selector scrolls horizontally
- [ ] Progress ring animates smoothly
- [ ] Progress bar shows accurate progress
- [ ] Loading skeletons shimmer correctly
- [ ] All components respect color scheme

---

### Animation Testing

#### Performance
- [ ] Spring animations run at 60fps
- [ ] No frame drops on button presses
- [ ] Celebration animations smooth
- [ ] Glass effects don't degrade scrolling
- [ ] Toast animations smooth

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Reduced motion respected (animations disabled)
- [ ] User can toggle animations in settings
- [ ] No flashing content (seizure risk)
- [ ] Animations enhance, don't distract

---

### ADHD Feature Testing

#### Visual Timeline
- [ ] Renders with 0 captures correctly (empty state)
- [ ] Renders with 50 captures correctly
- [ ] Renders with 100+ captures correctly (performance)
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling is smooth
- [ ] Tap to view capture details works
- [ ] Color coding is clear and consistent
- [ ] Time labels are readable at all sizes

#### Cognitive Load Assessment (User Testing)
- [ ] Timeline reduces time blindness (feedback)
- [ ] Next up indicators not anxiety-inducing (feedback)
- [ ] Completion animations feel rewarding (feedback)
- [ ] Settings allow adequate customization
- [ ] Features can be turned off easily
- [ ] Overall cognitive load feels manageable

---

### Accessibility Testing

#### VoiceOver
- [ ] All screens navigable with VoiceOver
- [ ] All buttons have descriptive labels
- [ ] Form inputs announced correctly
- [ ] Lists read items in logical order
- [ ] Modals announced properly

- [ ] Glass effects don't obscure text
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and clear

#### Dynamic Type
- [ ] Extra Small text readable
