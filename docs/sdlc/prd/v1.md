- [ADR-0001: Technology Stack](../decisions/ADR-0001-stack.md)

## 1. Product overview

**Offload** is an iOS app that reduces mental overload by allowing users to quickly capture entries (thoughts, tasks, ideas) and optionally organize them with AI. The app prioritizes **externalizing first**, **organizing later**, and **never forcing structure**.

---

## 2. Problem statement

Users experience stress when ideas, tasks, or plans accumulate faster than they can organize them. Existing tools require upfront categorization, which increases avoidance.

**Core user pain:**
> “I need this out of my head now, but organizing it feels like too much.”

---

## 3. Product goals (V1)

- Enable instant thought capture with minimal friction
- Provide optional, trustworthy AI-assisted organization
- Reduce cognitive load without introducing pressure or guilt
- Validate willingness to pay for AI-assisted relief

---

## 4. Non-goals (explicit)

- No automatic task creation without confirmation
- No calendar scheduling or reminders
- No collaboration or sharing
- No cross-platform support (iPhone only; no iPad in v1)
- No multi-device sync in v1
- No complex onboarding flows

---

## 5. Target audience

- People experiencing high cognitive load (work, family, planning)
- Those who struggle with traditional productivity tools that require upfront organization
- Comfortable with mobile-first tools
- Sensitive to stress-inducing UX patterns
- Particularly beneficial for people with ADHD or similar executive function challenges

---

## 6. Success metrics (30-day post-launch)

### V1 (Manual-only)
- ≥30% Day-30 retention for users who create ≥5 captures
- ≥20% of users create at least one Plan
- App Store rating ≥4.5
- <2% crash-free session rate

### Post-v1 (AI-enabled)
- ≥25% Day-30 retention for users who complete ≥1 AI organize action
- ≥40% of free users hit monthly AI limit
- 8–12% conversion from free → paid after limit hit

---

## 7. Core user flows

### 7.1 Primary flow (Capture → Hand-off → Decision → Placement)

1. User creates a **CaptureEntry** (text or voice)
2. Entry is immediately saved with `pending` status
3. User optionally initiates **Hand-off** (AI organization request)
4. AI returns **Suggestions** with confidence scores
5. User reviews suggestions and makes **Decisions** (accept/reject/edit)
6. Accepted items create **Placements** in Plans or Lists

### 7.2 Fallback flow

- If AI unavailable or limit reached:
  - CaptureEntry remains in pending state
  - User sees: "Saved. Organize later."

---

## 8. Functional requirements

### 8.1 Capture (CaptureEntry)

- Text input (single field)
- Voice recording
  - One-tap record/stop
  - On-device transcription (Apple Speech framework)
  - Supported languages only; no fallback for unsupported languages
- Works offline
- Immediate persistence

**Stored data (CaptureEntry)**

- id (UUID)
- rawText (immutable)
- createdAt (timestamp)
- source (text / voice)
- status (pending / processing / completed / failed)

---

### 8.2 Capture List View

- Chronological list of all CaptureEntries
- Visual distinction by status:
  - Pending (not yet organized)
  - Processing (hand-off in progress)
  - Completed (suggestions accepted)
- Actions:
  - Hand-off (request AI organization)
  - Delete
  - Re-process

Captures are never auto-cleared; user controls retention.

---

### 8.3 AI organization (Hand-off)

Triggered only by user action (creates HandOffRequest).

AI analyzes CaptureEntry and returns Suggestions for:

- **Plan** with Tasks (multi-step projects)
- **ListEntity** with ListItems (shopping, packing, etc.)
- **CommunicationItem** (calls, emails, messages)
- **Task** (standalone actionable item)

**AI output requirements (Suggestion)**

- Strict structured JSON
- Confidence score per suggestion
- Optional clarification questions
- Never invent items beyond user intent
- Each HandOffRun tracks the AI attempt and response

---

### 8.4 Review screen (SuggestionDecision)

User must be able to:

- Edit suggested titles
- Edit item text
- Remove individual suggestions
- Change destination (Plan, List, etc.)
- Cancel without losing original CaptureEntry

**No Placement is created without explicit user decision.**

Each user action creates a SuggestionDecision record (accepted/rejected/edited).

---

### 8.5 Plans & Lists

**Plan** (lightweight project)
- Contains Tasks
- Supports parent/child hierarchy
- No due dates required in V1

**ListEntity** (general-purpose lists)
- Contains ListItems
- Types: shopping, packing, reference, etc.

**CommunicationItem** (calls, emails, messages) — *Post-v1*
- Standalone items for follow-up actions
- Future: iOS integration (Contacts, Mail, Messages)

No reminders in V1.

---

## 9. Pricing & limits (hybrid model)

### Free tier

- 30 AI organization actions per month
- Unlimited capture
- Unlimited manual lists

### Paid tier (single SKU)

- Unlimited AI (soft caps enforced)
- Faster processing
- Early feature access

### Enforcement

- Limits enforced server-side
- Graceful fallback messaging
- No dark patterns

---

## 10. AI & backend requirements

> **Note:** This section applies to post-v1 releases. V1 is manual-only with no backend dependency.

### Architecture (Post-v1)

iOS App → Backend API → LLM Provider

### Backend responsibilities

- User/session identification
- Quota enforcement
- LLM request/response handling
- JSON schema validation
- Minimal logging

### Privacy constraints

- No API keys on device
- No training on user data
- Minimal retention
- Clear privacy policy

---

## 11. Data model (V1)

## 12. UX & tone requirements

> See [ADR-0003: ADHD UX Guardrails](../decisions/ADR-0003-adhd-ux-guardrails.md) for detailed design constraints.

### Tone
- No shaming or urgency language
- No productivity guilt framing
- Optional light humor (off by default)
- Copy emphasizes control and relief

**Example:**
> "Saved. You don't have to deal with this right now."

### ADHD-Focused Design Principles

**Capture-first default**
- Persistent capture control with immediate-save behavior
- Organizing is optional and secondary

**Undo over confirmation**
- Destructive actions use undo banners/snackbars (not blocking modals)
- Exception: batch destructive actions may use confirmation

**Calm visual system**
- Restrained palette: base + primary accent + secondary accent
- Accessible contrast ratios
- Consistent spacing tokens to reduce visual noise

**Predictable navigation**
- Core areas one tap away via main tab shell
- Capture uses sheets; editing uses full screens
- Swipe actions mirrored with visible buttons

**Gentle organization prompts**
- Non-blocking chips/cards (e.g., "Ready to organize")
- Snooze/dismiss options on all prompts
- No urgency language or forced flows

### Accessibility Requirements

- Dynamic Type support (all text scales)
- Reduce Motion support (disable animations when enabled)
- Minimum 44×44 pt tap targets
- Focus states combine color and stroke weight

## 13. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| AI cost spikes | Hard per-user caps |
| Misclassification | Review screen + confidence |
| User distrust | Raw text preserved |
| Overbuilding | Strict V1 scope lock |

---

## 14. Implementation tracking

> **Note:** Detailed implementation status is tracked in the [Master Plan](../plans/master-plan.md), which is the single source of truth for progress.

### High-level phases

1. **Core Infrastructure** — SwiftData models, repositories, capture foundation
2. **Critical Remediation** — Bug fixes, error handling, architecture improvements
3. **UI/UX Modernization** — Design system, component library, ADHD enhancements
4. **AI Integration** — Hand-off flow, backend proxy, usage limits
5. **Release** — TestFlight beta, App Store submission

See [master-plan.md](../plans/master-plan.md) for current status and detailed task breakdown.
