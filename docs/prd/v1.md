# Offload — V1 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product overview
**Offload** is an iOS app for adults with ADHD that reduces mental overload by allowing users to quickly capture thoughts and optionally organize them with AI. The app prioritizes **externalizing first**, **organizing later**, and **never forcing structure**.

---

## 2. Problem statement
Users experience stress when ideas, tasks, or plans accumulate faster than they can organize them. Existing tools require upfront categorization, which increases avoidance.

**Core user pain:**
> “I need this out of my head now, but organizing it feels like too much.”

---

## 3. Product goals (V1)
- Enable instant thought capture with minimal friction
- Provide optional, trustworthy AI-assisted organization
- Reduce cognitive load without introducing pressure or guilt
- Validate willingness to pay for AI-assisted relief

---

## 4. Non-goals (explicit)
- No automatic task creation without confirmation
- No calendar scheduling or reminders
- No collaboration or sharing
- No cross-platform support
- No complex onboarding flows

---

## 5. Target audience
- Adults with ADHD (diagnosed or self-identified)
- High cognitive load (work, family, planning)

3. User optionally taps **Organize**
4. AI returns structured suggestions
5. User reviews and confirms
6. Items are saved to lists/projects

### 7.2 Fallback flow
