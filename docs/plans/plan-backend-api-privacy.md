# Plan: Backend API + Privacy Constraints (Pre-launch Candidate)

## Overview

Execution plan for backend API and privacy constraints listed as additional
pre-launch scope in the roadmap. Work should begin only after scope is confirmed
via PRD/ADR updates.

## Goals

- Define backend API integration needs for AI features.
- Establish privacy constraints and compliance requirements.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Scope Confirmation

**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Confirm scope approval in PRD/ADR updates.
- [ ] Identify data flows that require backend support.

### Phase 2: API & Privacy Definition

**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Document API endpoints and data handling expectations.
- [ ] Define privacy constraints and data retention policies.

### Phase 3: Implementation & Validation

**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Implement API integration scaffolding.
- [ ] Validate data handling against privacy requirements.

## Dependencies

- Approved PRD/ADR updates for AI scope.
- Security and compliance review readiness.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy constraints change late | H | Lock requirements before implementation. |
| Backend API delays | H | Sequence implementation after API readiness. |

## Progress

| Date | Update |
