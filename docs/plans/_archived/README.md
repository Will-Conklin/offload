# Archived Plans

## Purpose

Preserve completed or superseded plans for historical reference.

## Authority

Same authority as plans, but no longer active. Archived plans are historical records and must not reintroduce scope or decisions.

## What belongs here

- Completed plans with outcomes recorded.
- Superseded plans retained for audit or context.

## What does not belong here

- Active plans or ongoing work items (use plans/).
- New requirements, decisions, or design changes.
